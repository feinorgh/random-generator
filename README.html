<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p><code>random</code> generates series of unique random integers
in an arbitrary range. More specifically it means that it generates
an ordered set of integers which is guaranteed not to contain any
number more than once. It makes use of the GMP Library (The GNU MP
Bignum Library) for generating integers of any imaginable order
(given the limitations on memory, processing power, the shell's
ability to provide long enough arguments, the user's ability to
type them etc.).</p>
<h1>Operation</h1>
<p>By default the program generates one number between 1 and
100.</p>
<p>It can take a number of options to control the size and range of
the generated set:</p>
<pre>
  -l, --lower=&lt;number&gt;     Lower bound (inclusive). Default is 1.
  -u, --upper=&lt;number&gt;     Upper bound (inclusive). Default is 100.
  -c, --count=&lt;number&gt;     Generate this many unique numbers.
</pre>
<p>The lower and upper bounds can accept negative numbers (although
the lower bound must always be lower than the upper).</p>
<p>There is a limit on the size of the set (currently set to
<strong>UINT_MAX</strong> from your system's
'<code>/usr/include/limits.h</code>') which is primarily designed
for simplicity of implementation. Generating very large sets of
random numbers is pretty silly anyway, and takes a lot of time and
memory, so if you want to, you can give it a go to generate a set
of 20 000 000 numbers, but don't come crying and say I didn't warn
you when your swap space has run out. There's nothing stopping you
from shooting yourself in the foot. And there shouldn't be.</p>
<h1>Humorously Big Numbers</h1>
<p>You may find that you want to generate extremely big random
numbers, and that the argument list becomes too long for the system
to handle. In that case you can read values from a file with the
<code>-f &lt;file&gt;</code> option. The file shall contain only
two values, separated by a space: the lower and the upper bound.
Again, these may be negative values. You can also read from
<code>stdin</code>, of course.</p>
<h1>Excuse</h1>
<p>This was written mostly for learning the GNU MP library and for
the fun of it. Hopefully you will find this software useful and a
maybe even slightly fun. I used it's predecessor for generating
image indexes in a shell script on a web server once. (It could
only generate measly standard <code>int</code>s though). And if you
make a Lotto row with the help of this program I wish you the best
of luck trying to win.</p>
<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This software may contain bugs. If you find one, please notify
me. Also, if you have suggestions, improvements or comments, I'd
like to hear about it. Also, it uses the popt library, which is
great. Except for one brain hemorrhage: The automated help it
generates uses '<code>-? | --help</code>' as an option. I didn't
bother to plug that hole. Use <code>--help</code> if you want to
see the options. Also, the software lacks test cases and QA, so you
might not want to rely on this particular piece of software to
drive trains, planes or automobiles.</p>
<h1>Thank You</h1>
<p>The good people at <a href="http://swox.com">swox.com</a> for
writing and maintaining the GMP library.</p>
<p>The GNU people and Donald Knuth for the binary tree
implementation used herein.</p>
<p>Mikael Magnusson (Mikachu) and Erik Waling (ddl) for suggestions
and improvements (generate excluded numbers when the size of the
set is more than half the range (Mikachu); reading parameters from
a file (Mikachu); reading a random seed (ddl) ).</p>
